# AH20250831 Multiple IPs/net-device are also possible with NetworkManager,
#   but NMs DHCP gets angry if it can't get an IP and start resetting eth0
#   after a couple of tries. By this it looses the internal LAN IP.
#   Remember CM4's LAN interface has always a carrier because it's wired with
#   xCore's switch and not the LAN plug on the carrier board.
