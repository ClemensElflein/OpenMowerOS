# Dnsmasq is designed to choose IP addresses for DHCP clients using a hash of the client's MAC address.
# This normally allows a client's address to remain stable long-term, even if the client  sometimes
# allows its DHCP lease to expire. In this default mode IP addresses are distributed pseudo-randomly
# over the entire available address range. There are sometimes circumstances (typically server deployment)
# where it is more convenient to have IP addresses allocated sequentially,
# starting from the lowest available address, and setting this flag enables this mode.
# Note that in the sequential mode, clients which allow a lease to expire are much more likely to move IP address;
# for this reason it should not be generally used.

# For debugging purposes, log each DNS query as it passes through
# dnsmasq.

# Log lots of extra information about DHCP transactions.
