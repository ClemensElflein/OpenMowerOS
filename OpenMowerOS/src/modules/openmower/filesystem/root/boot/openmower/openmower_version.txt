# Choose the version of OpenMower software you want to run.
#
# We use a system called semantic versioning (semver) for our software builds.
# This helps you know what kind of updates are included in each version.
#
# For example, if we release version 1.2.3:
# - The `1` indicates the major version, which changes when there are big updates that might not be compatible with older versions.
# - The `2` indicates the minor version, which changes when new features are added that are still compatible with the previous major version.
# - The `3` indicates the patch version, which changes when there are small fixes or improvements.
#
# Each version like 1.2.3 will also have tags `1` and `1.2`. These tags help you stay updated with all the latest
# fixes and features within a major or minor series.
# So, if you use tag `1`, you will get the latest updates for all 1.x.x versions,
# and with `1.2`, you'll get updates for all 1.2.x versions.
#
# There's also an `edge` version, built from the latest master branch. These are prerelease versions that look
# like `1.2.3-edge.nn`. The number after `edge` changes very frequently and includes the latest developments.
# It's great if you want to try the newest features right away or if you're involved in the development process.
# However, be aware that these versions might have bugs and are not as stable as the official releases.
#
